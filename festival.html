                        instantly comes to the mind. This is an actually an ancient Hindu festival which is dedicated to
                        the Sun God, Surya, and take place 6 days after Diwali. It is an expression of thanks giving and
                        seeking blessings from the Almighty for sustaining life on Earth. During this festival, the
                        person observing Chatth, also known as Parvati, observes a fast from dawn to dusk which
                        concludes with sweets. This fast is followed by another fast for 36 hours till the final day,
                        when puja starts at the river, before sunrise. You can witness thousands of devotees and the
                        river during this time. Witnessing Chatth Puja will let you witness the devotion in its true
                        sense.</p>

                    <p>During the winter when the birds migrate from the Himalayas towards the plains, the celebration
                        of Sama-Chakeva takes place. This festival is celebrated specifically in Mithila. When the
                        colourful birds migrate towards their land, this festival takes place, marking the
                        brother-sister relationship. It starts with welcoming the pair of birds Sama- Chakeva. The girls
                        make an idol of the birds and decorate them in their own traditional way. After this, the
                        festivities take place with full splendour, and ends by a Vidaai of the Sama, with a wish that
                        these birds return to the land the next year.</p>

                    <p>The Makar Sankranti Mela is held every year at Rajgir (a town in Bihar) in the month of January.
                        The devotees make flower offering to the deities in the temple and take a dip in the holy water.
                        Another site associated with this festival is the Mandar Hills in the Banka district. According
                        to legends, a great Asura once threatened the gods. The Lord Vishnu cut off the Asura’s head and
                        piled up the body under the weight of the Mandar hill. The famous panchjanya – the sankh (conch
                        shell) used in the Mahabharat war is believed to have been found here on the hills. This makes
                        it a rather famous festival of the state.</p>
