    <h2 class="section-title">History of Bihar</h2>
    <p>
      Two of India’s most glorious dynasties, Mauryas (321 - 185 BCE) and Guptas (320 - 550 CE), flourished in ancient Bihar, known then as Magadh. The great King Ashoka, born in 304 BCE, ruled from Pataliputra (present-day Patna) and expanded his empire across South Asia.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Gupta period, often called India’s golden age, was also based in Magadh. Bihar was home to the ancient universities Nalanda (5th century) and Vikramshila (8th century), where students from around the world studied. Bihar also hosted the world’s first democracy in Vaishali, governed by the Lichchavis.

    <h2 class="section-title">Spiritual Greatness</h2>
    <p>
      Bihar is spiritually rich. It is where Buddhism originated—Buddha attained enlightenment in Bodh Gaya. Jainism also flourished here, with Mahavira attaining Nirvana at Pawapuri.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Hinduism, Gaya is a prominent pilgrimage site for ancestral offerings. Epics like the Ramayana and Mahabharata are deeply linked with Bihar, and the sage Valmiki, who authored Ramayana, belonged to this region.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bihar was a hub of Sufism during the Islamic period, with saints like Imam Taj Faqih, Shihabuddin Pir, and Syed Muhammad of Amjhar Sharif promoting unity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Guru Gobind Singh Ji, the tenth Sikh Guru, was born in Patna in 1660. The Takht Shri Har Mandir Ji Sahib commemorates his birthplace and is one of Sikhism’s five Akal Takhts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pilgrims can follow different circuits: Buddhist, Jain, Ramayana, Sufi, Hindu, and Sikh—each reflecting Bihar's historical and spiritual richness. In the 12th century CE, Bakhtiar Khilji attacked Bihar and destroyed many historic sites. Later, Sher Shah Suri built the Grand Trunk Road during his rule.
